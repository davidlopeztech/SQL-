# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID"; 

#2. How many of those orders were an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(product) 
FROM jansales 
WHERE product = "iPhone" 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID"; 

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM customers 
LEFT JOIN febsales 
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT MIN(price) 
, product
FROM jansales 
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc 
LIMIT 1 ;
-- Another way to answer question 4.
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
, product
FROM jansales 
GROUP BY product;
 
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity)
, product
, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM febsales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT Count(distinct cust.acctnum)
, AVG(quantity*price)
FROM febsales 
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON febsales.orderID = cust.order_ID
WHERE febsales.Quantity > "2"
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID"; 

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity) 
FROM febsales
WHERE location like "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY product ;
